            </p>
        <h3>Use only one H1 tag</h3>
        <p>Every page requires just one H1 tag. Stuffing the tags adds no value 
            to the page. This is because, as the search engine crawl on every page,
            they are likely to have an easier job if they focus their efforts on one 
            H1 tag. Having many of them on a single page may not necessarily confuse
            the search engine but could drain their crawling power.
        </p>
        <h3>
            The tag should be descibing the content of your page
        </h3>
        <p>This will give the readers a hint of what they should be expecting 
            to find even before they start reading the material. Mostly, the H1 tag
            should br similar to your title tag. It is the title of the blog. The 
            primary aim of H1 tag is to give readers a strong hint of what they are 
            about to read
        </p>
        <h3>It should not exceed 70 characters</h3>
        <p>The minimum number of character should be 20 and a maximum of 70. 
         Do not exaggerete the length of the length. If the tag is too long, 
         it might dilute the power of the HTML tag.
        </p>
        <h3>Make it stand out</h3>
        <p>This aspect is the most vital element of your blog. For it to stand 
            out, it should be robust, noticeable and big. Do as much visual 
            formatting as you can, using all the necessary fonts and style to mamke 
            it stand out.
        </p>
        <h3>Use long tail Keyword</h3>
        <p>Using short keyword may tempt you to stuff the header text  with
            keywords which may cause it to have an extremely high keyword density.
            This is not recommendable as it disrupts the flow thus lowering it's 
            quality.
